Data Extract Using VBA

I use VBA on a daily basis to automate many of the analysis, visualization and reporting of financial datasets. From time to time, I have to create new codes and automation to help programmers in our team run mundane tasks.

This is one of the VBA scripts I wrote that extracts specific datasets from 120+ excel files and compiles these cells to another master excel file.
