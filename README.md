# Automated Data Extraction Using VBA

I use VBA on a daily basis to automate many of the analysis, visualization and reporting of financial datasets. From time to time, I have to create new codes and automation to help programmers in our team run mundane tasks.

This is one of the VBA scripts I wrote that extracts specific datasets from 120+ excel files and compiles them to another master excel file.

P/S: I have removed all associated Company information (names, variables etc) so this code only contains my VBA solution.
